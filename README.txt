This CueWeighting_MMN project is investigating the the neural signature of down-weighting observed in the dimension-based statistical learning paradigm. In particular, it uses mismatch negativity (MMN) to investigate whether changing the statisitcal distribution of the acoustic dimensions affects encoding of a particular acoustic dimension, and if so, the temporal window that this effect takes place. The temporal window can give us insight into whether the effect is related to encoding of acoustic dimensions or other high-level processing. 

The MMN.m psychtoolbox script is in collaboration with Tim Noland from Barb Shin-Cunningham's lab who will start his PhD in the Neural Computation program this fall. He wrote the hardware portion of the code while I implemented the algorithms for the stimulus presentation and procedures.
